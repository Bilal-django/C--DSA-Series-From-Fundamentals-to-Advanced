# C--DSA-Series-From-Fundamentals-to-Advanced
Welcome to my DSA series in C++! This repository is a structured journey from beginner to advanced topics in Data Structures and Algorithms, designed to help deepen my understanding of C++ and create a resource for others interested in mastering these fundamental concepts.
My goal with this project is to build a strong understanding of DSA in C++ and showcase my skills in hopes of landing a role in a top software company. Contributions and feedback are welcome, so feel free to check out my code, share your thoughts, or collaborate on improving this repository.
                              FIRST WE LEARN PSEUDOCODE
Pseudocode is a way to describe a program’s logic and steps in plain language. It’s written in a structured format that resembles code but without strict programming syntax. Pseudocode helps bridge the gap between the human thought process and actual programming languages by outlining what each part of the code does without worrying about language-specific details.                              
                              ABOVE CODE EXPLAINATION 
In the pseudocode for the calculator program, we outlined the following:

The Purpose of Each Step: We described each part of the code, such as declaring variables, taking inputs, performing calculations, and displaying results.

Logical Flow of the Program: We structured the sequence of operations from input to output, making it easy to follow the program’s logic.

Explanation of Calculations: Each mathematical operation is clearly mentioned, so the reader knows the purpose of each calculation step.

Use of Basic Programming Concepts: The pseudocode includes concepts like input/output, variable declaration, and arithmetic operations in a simplified format, making it easy to translate into actual code.
